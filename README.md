# <Gett 데이터분석> 

# Project Background
Gett(이전 명칭: GetTaxi)는 우버와 같은 이스라엘의 차량 공유 플랫폼으로 고객이 택시를 주문하고 운전자가 그 주문을 수락할 수 있는 애플리케이션입니다 (고객이 애플리케이션에서 '주문' 버튼을 클릭하면, 매칭 시스템이 가장 적합한 운전자를 찾아 주문을 제안하는 방식). 
이 프로젝트에서는 성공적으로 완료되지 않은 주문, 즉 고객이 차량을 이용하지 못한 주문에 대한 일부 매칭 지표를 조사하여 매칭성공률이 개선되기 위한 방안에 대해 알아보고자 합니다.
(Background about the company, including the industry, active years, business model, and key business metrics. Explain this from the POV of a data analyst who is working at the company.)

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Explain the overarching findings, trends, and themes in 2-3 sentences here. This section should address the question: "If a stakeholder were to take away 3 main insights from your project, what are the most important things they should know?" You can put yourself in the shoes of a specific stakeholder - for example, a marketing manager or finance director - to think creatively about this section.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
